h1. clj-diff-performance

Compare performance of various diff algorithms. The unit tests also compare the results of the various algorithms with random input.

Currently, three algorithms are being compared: "Miller":http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=96223, "Myers":http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf and "Fraser":http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/. Miller and Myers are written in Clojure and Fraser is written in Java. All algorithms take advantage of the pre-diff optimizations mentioned in Neil Fraser's "Diff Strategies":http://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/.

h2. Results

For sequences of length 100, vary the number of mutations made to the sequence from 1 to 50. These changes will always replace existing values so that the new sequence is the same size as the old one.

For sequences of length 1000, vary the number of mutations from 1 to 500.

Vary the length of the sequences, with 5%, 10% and 50% change.

Move the first element of the sequence to the end.

Make a small change in the middle of the sequence.
